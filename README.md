Description of the Project: This code is for a web-based game or simulation that creates and animates Pac-Man characters. When a new Pac-Man is made using makePac(), it is given a random position and velocity, and an image element is created and placed in the game area. The update() function moves each Pac-Man based on its velocity and checks for collisions with the window boundaries, reversing direction and cycling through images to simulate movement. The startGame() function sets this update process to repeat at intervals, creating the animation loop. Event listeners are added to DOM elements to create new Pac-Men and start the game when the user interacts with the page.

How to Run: You can clone this project onto your machine and run index.html in the browser. You will have two buttons that appear, one that starts the game, and one that loads a new pacman upon each click.

Roadmap of Future Improvements: I'm not sure where I plan to take this code in the future but it is helpful to review for animated movement.
